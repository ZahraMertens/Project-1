## General Information

```
As a user I want to find restaurants in a specific location So that I can find the best rated ones.

## Brainstorming

* HTML page which includes a search bar to search a specific city and postcode
* A second HTML page will show the best 5 results 
* A link at the end of the listed items gives the option to view more results 
* Ones the results are shown on the webpage if we click on the li element a marker will appear on the google map marker 

## Acceptance Criteria

* WHEN the page loads the user can see a form element with input fields with the option to search the city(location) and post code
* WHEN both values are entered and the submit button is preset it will take you two the seond page which displays the 5 top rated restaurants and show the distance between
* WHEN the user clicks on the card showing the search results THEN the card expands to show the location on the map
* When the user clicks on the map THEN it will take you to the google maps application
