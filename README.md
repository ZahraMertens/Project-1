# Cocktail HUB
## A simple web app for all cocktail related information.  

### Description  

Cocktail Hub is the first collaborative group project for USYD Coding Bootcamp 2021. This project focuses on building a website and help satisfy the curiosities of our users, regarding all the information about making a perfect cocktail at home.  

Cocktail HUB is an interface for accessing the api provided by TheCockailDB database via Rapid API, It makes finding recipes for cocktails quick and easy, and is the center point for those looking to try out new drinks. 

The project was motivated by the close down of the pub and bars due to covid-19 virus. Most of us couldn't enjoy the cocktails made by our favorite bartender in recent years. Hence this project is created where you can learn the art and craft of making cocktail at home and enjoy it with your loved ones.
