## Description
CocktailHUB is our interface for accessing the cocktail database API, It makes finding recipes for cocktails quick and easy, and is the center point for those looking to try out new drinks. 

We built this project to help satisfy the curiousities of our users and ourselves while Covid keeps us from going out and having fun. Through this experience, we learnt the importance of properly researching an API before implementing it into our designs, and honed our skills in the implementation of API intregration into a website

## Usage
Using our website is easy! Simply type the name of a kind of spirit into the search bar and press search. The following webpage will present your with a variety of different cocktail options. Once you've found a cocktail to your liking, click on the plus symbol on the name card of the cocktail, and you will be presented with ingredients and instructions on how to create your selected cocktail.

Go out there and have fun!
